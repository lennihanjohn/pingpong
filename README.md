# The Task

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Add a feature to add new players to the Add Result drop downs.
3. Add some validation to addResult function. Table tennis rules state that a player wins if they reach 11 points however the player needs to win by at least 2 points.
4. Create a league table to show a list of points in descending order. Players are awarded 2 points per win.
5. Fix the CEO to the bottom of the league (on 0 points).

### Bonus

1.  Seperate functionality into their own controllers, eg. resultController, playerController, leagueController. Data must persist accross the controllers (hint: use Services).
